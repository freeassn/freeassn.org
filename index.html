                    In the internet age, email has become one of the most
                    critically important services that any person uses.
                    Unfortunately, many people have seemingly become locked into
                    proprietary email providers that do not respect their
                    privacy. Free Association has set out to offer a viable
                    alternative to these providers for those who seek to protect
                    their privacy and return control over their digital lives to
                    themselves.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Free Association provides low-cost, privacy respecting
                    hosted email on a fully free-and-open-source software stack.
                    Currently, we are the primary email provider for about 100
                    individuals. As of October, 2024 we are in the process of
                    structuring Free Association as a worker-owned cooperative.

                    Free Association will not be taking registration for new
                    mailboxes while we make an organizational transition to
                    on-premises control of our email hosting infrastructure. We
                    expect this transition to be complete with public
                    registration available no later than April 1, 2025.

                    One will weave the canvas; another will fell a tree by the
                    light of his ax. Yet another will forge nails, and there
                    will be others who observe the stars to learn how to
                    navigate. And yet all will be as one. Building a boat isn’t
                    about weaving canvas, forging nails, or reading the sky.
                    It’s about giving a shared taste for the sea, by the light
                    of which you will see nothing contradictory but rather a
                    community of <span style="color: pink">love</span>.
